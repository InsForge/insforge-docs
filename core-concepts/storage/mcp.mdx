AI assistants handle file uploads and storage through MCP tools.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `create-bucket` | Create storage containers |
| `list-buckets` | View existing buckets |
| `delete-bucket` | Remove buckets |
| `get-storage-api` | Storage endpoints documentation |

## How AI Handles Storage

When you say "add profile pictures", the AI:

1. Calls `list-buckets` to check existing
2. Creates bucket if needed with `create-bucket`
3. Sets appropriate access (public for images)
4. Implements upload form with FormData
5. Stores URLs in database

## AI Understanding

The AI knows:
- Public buckets for images, private for documents
- FormData required for file uploads
- Automatic file renaming prevents overwrites
- URLs follow predictable pattern
- How to handle upload errors

## Common Flows

### Profile Pictures
```
You: "Add avatar uploads"
AI: [Creates 'avatars' bucket with public access]
AI: [Implements file input with preview]
AI: [Uploads to /api/storage/buckets/avatars/objects]
AI: [Saves URL to user profile]
```

### Document Management
```
You: "Users should upload resumes"
AI: [Creates 'documents' bucket with private access]
AI: [Adds file type validation]
AI: [Implements secure download with auth]
```

### Gallery System
```
You: "Create photo gallery"
AI: [Creates 'gallery' bucket]
AI: [Implements multi-file upload]
AI: [Stores URLs in photos table]
AI: [Creates grid display]
```

The AI handles bucket creation, access policies, and upload flows automatically.
