## What are Insforge Functions?

Insforge Functions are serverless JavaScript/TypeScript functions that run in an isolated Deno runtime environment. They enable you to execute custom backend logic with full access to the Insforge SDK and backend services.

## Architecture

Insforge Functions utilize a multi-layer architecture for security and performance:

    A[Client Request] --> B[Backend API :7130]
    B --> C[Proxy Layer]
    C --> D[Deno Runtime :7133]
    D --> E[Web Worker Sandbox]
    E --> F[Function Execution]
    F --> G[Response]
```

### Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Backend API Layer">
    - Manages function CRUD operations via `/api/functions`
    - Handles authentication and authorization
    - Proxies execution requests to Deno runtime
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deno Runtime">
    - Isolated execution environment
    - Manages worker lifecycle
    - Injects secrets and SDK access
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Web Worker Sandbox">
    - Each function runs in its own worker
    - 30-second execution timeout
    - No file system or network access except through SDK
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Features

### üöÄ Instant Deployment
Deploy functions immediately with a single API call. Changes take effect instantly without build steps.

### üîê Built-in Security
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Encrypted secrets storage
- Automatic authentication handling
- Request validation and sanitization

### üìä Full SDK Access
Access all Insforge services from your functions:
- Database operations
- Authentication & user management
- File storage
- AI integrations

### üåê HTTP-based Triggers
Functions are triggered via HTTP requests, supporting:
- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- JSON request/response bodies
- Custom headers
- Query parameters

</CardGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Single Endpoint Only**: Each function has exactly one endpoint. Functions do NOT support subpaths.
  - ‚úÖ Works: `/functions/my-api`
  - ‚ùå Doesn't work: `/functions/my-api/users`
</Warning>

### Execution Constraints
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds maximum execution time
- **Memory**: Limited by Deno worker allocation
- **No Direct File Access**: Use Storage API for files
- **No System Commands**: Process spawning is prohibited

### Development Constraints
- Functions are stateless (no persistent variables)
- Cannot import external npm packages (only `@insforge/sdk`)
- TypeScript supported but not type-checked at runtime
